The description appears in the skill list that the runner uses for routing. When a user sends a query, the runner decides whether to invoke the skill based on the skill name and this description. Your goal is to write a description that triggers for relevant queries and does not trigger for irrelevant ones.

Based on the failures, write a new and improved description that is more likely to trigger correctly. When I say "based on the failures", it's a bit of a tricky line to walk because we don't want to overfit to the specific cases you're seeing. So what I DON'T want you to do is produce an ever-expanding list of specific queries that this skill should or shouldn't trigger for. Instead, try to generalize from the failures to broader categories of user intent and situations where this skill would be useful or not useful. The reason for this is twofold:

1. Avoid overfitting
2. The list might get loooong and it's injected into ALL queries and there might be a lot of skills, so we don't want to blow too much space on any given description.

Concretely, your description should not be more than about 100-200 words, even if that comes at the cost of accuracy. There is a hard limit of 1024 characters — descriptions over that will be truncated, so stay comfortably under it.

Here are some tips that we've found to work well in writing these descriptions:
- The skill should be phrased in the imperative -- "Use this skill for" rather than "this skill does"
- The skill description should focus on the user's intent, what they are trying to achieve, vs. the implementation details of how the skill works.
- The description competes with other skills for the model's attention, so make it distinctive and immediately recognizable.
- If you're getting lots of failures after repeated attempts, change things up. Try different sentence structures or wordings.

I'd encourage you to be creative and mix up the style in different iterations since you'll have multiple opportunities to try different approaches and we'll just grab the highest-scoring one at the end.
